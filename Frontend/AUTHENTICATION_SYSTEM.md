# Smart Electronics - Unified Authentication System

## Overview
The SmartElectronics application now features a modern, unified authentication system that seamlessly combines login and registration functionality in a single, switchable form.

## Key Features 

### ðŸ”„ **Switchable Interface**
- Single component (`AuthForm.jsx`) handles both login and registration
- Smooth transitions between login and registration modes
- URL-aware: automatically detects `/login` vs `/register` routes
- Beautiful split-screen design with branded left panel

### ðŸ“§ **Email OTP Verification**
- Secure email-based OTP verification for new registrations
- Integration with Gmail SMTP service
- Real-time OTP validation
- Visual feedback during verification process

### ðŸ‘¤ **Progressive Profile Completion**
- Step-by-step registration process
- Required fields: Name, Email, Password
- Optional fields: Phone, Address (Landmark, City, State, Pincode)
- Consistent address format across registration and profile pages

### ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI/UX**
- Material-UI components with custom styling
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- Social login placeholders for future integration
- Loading states and error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Routes
- `/login` - Opens AuthForm in login mode
- `/register` - Opens AuthForm in registration mode
- Both routes use the same `AuthForm` component

### Authentication Flow

#### Login Flow:
1. User enters email and password
2. Direct authentication via `/auth/login` endpoint
3. JWT token stored and user redirected to home

#### Registration Flow:
1. User enters email and password
2. OTP sent via `/auth/register` endpoint
3. User verifies OTP via `/auth/verify-email-otp` endpoint
4. Profile completion via `/auth/complete-registration` endpoint
5. Success message and redirect to home

### Key Components
- `AuthForm.jsx` - Main unified authentication component
- `App.jsx` - Updated routing configuration
- Removed legacy components: `Login.jsx`, `RegisterTwoStep.jsx`, `LoginAuth.jsx`

## Benefits
